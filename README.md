## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

In the future I would like to improve how I work with inline SVGs. Right now I struggle to not make them look awkward but it's all a process. I would also like to work on writing more organized CSS classes.

Another struggle I had was with the local fonts. It was simple to use them in my development environment, but when deployed on Netlify I was unable to load the local fonts, and after lots of trial and error I resorted to using Google Fonts. I definitely need to spend some more time experimenting with Netlify and loading font assets.
